- Models often treat consciousness as a global, dynamic process (rather than a localized phenonenon)
  - Consciousness can survive localized cortical damage and will only face if sub-cortical systems are compromised.

- NREM sleep is an attractive way to compare non-consciousness with consciousness.
  - Subjects can be studied in both conscious and nonconscous states.



Global Workspace Theory and Frontoparietal connectivity
-------------------------------------------------------
- States consciousness serves and integrative role.
- Conscousness content is characterized by its global availibility and can be access by different cognitive processes (ex: broadcased to an 'audience' of distributed, parallel networks which can process information unconsciously)
- The Integratin of Info into a global resource accounts for the serial nature of conscious experience.

Prediction: unconscious stimuli will activate cortical areas restriced to low level sensory processing, wheras the passage to consciousness will ivolve activity in a constellation of regions transcending the sensory corticies.
  - frontoparietal network of regions is key in this.
    - Supported by experiements contrasting conscious vs. unconscious perception.

- It has not been firmly established whether sleep correlates with a global connectivity breakdown or only with a frontoparietal disconnection.
  - However EEG correlated with nifferent networks measured with fMRI shows invariant results (in terms of preserved topographic maps) across NREM sleep.

- Interesting observation: deep sleep disrupts the coherence of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations inside the DMN, but does not completely eliminate the network.



Informations Integration (Tononi)
---------------------------------
- Two characteristics of every conscious scene are its highly integrated, indivisible nature, and its high information content. 
- Information Integration- the system as a whole generates more information that what would be expected fro the independent contribution of all of its parts.

- Model argues that conscious awareness is a function of a system's capacity for information inegration.
  - Apparent information integration capacity of any physical system can be quantified in a numerical quantity, phi.

- This model predicts that states of diminished conscious awareness- such as NREM, should be characterized by impaired information integration. (lower phi)
  - Simulations suggest that information integration is decreased for systems whose units behave in a synchronous way, since the repertoire of possible states is reduced.
    - During NREM sleep, cortical dynamics become bistable, with periods of firing, and periods of quiescence. 
   - Simulations also suggest that high values of information integration require network architectures displaying both functional specialization (segregated functional processes) and functional integration between them.

   - Recent study:
      - Hypothesized that deep sleep would (1) result in an alteration of the integration-segregation balace of brain activity and (2) that this alteratio would correlate with the power of slow cortical rhythms.
      - Represened whole-brain interactions as a functional network.

- Phi shows a problems because it requires the calculation of the MIP which can only be done by exhaustively evaluating the effective information across all pairs of non-overlapping subsets. Impossible for the number of voxels recoreded.



The Dynamical Core Hypothesis
-----------------------------
- Experiemental observations strongly suggest that the thalamocortical system is crucial for consciousness.
  - Not only regions outside this system are irrelevent in terms of conscious content, but also localized thalamocortical lesions can be compatible with preserved consciousness.
  - Further evidence suggests that neural firing in a distributed subset of thalamocortical neurons occurs in response to any given conscious percept.
    - It has been suggested that such a group of neurons must have the following properties (1) must be a functional cluster ( consist of neurons with stronger interactions between them than with the rest of the thalamocortical system : analogous to the functional modules concept of prev. section), (2) This functional cluster must be highly differeniated (must admit a large repertoire of possible activity patterns).
    - In order to contribute to conscious content a neuron or group of neurons must participate in this thalamocortical functional cluster, termed "dynamical core".
      - Emphasizes the changing nature of the functional cluster: its configureation is postulated to constantly change at a scale of hundereds of milliseconds to accommodate the ongoing stream of conscious perception and medtation.
        - As such, it is a categorical error to discuss where in the brain consciousness takes place or which neurons are engaged in its generation, since consciousness is a dynamical process which constantly reorganizes and always comprises a highly differentiated thalamocortical functional cluster.
- BOLD functional connectiviy is dynamical and widely fluctuates over time (range between seconds and minutes).



Consciousness During NREM Sleep
-------------------------------
- Stages of sleep based on associated behavioral and cognitive changes.
  - Early Sleep (N1) - characterized by recollections of vivid hypnagogic hallucinations and lucid dreams, cognitive operations similar to those preformed during wakefulness for minutes after the thalamic deactivation occuring during onset.
  - Deeper Sleep (N2/N3) - often do not report any conscious report prior to awakening.
    - Not completly void of conscious awareness. Less lengthy than those obtained after REM and less vivid and elaborated. 
      - Does not suggest however that NREM sleep in an inadequate model for unconsciousness.


Conclusions
-----------
- Functional connctivity analyses reveal the disintegration of frontoparietal connectivity during deep sleep.
- Global functional connectivity networks studied with graph theory confirm the deepest stages of NREM sleep are associated with increased functional modularity.
